        <div class="contant">The genus mollie or mollienesia, as it was originally classified, has some of the most
            beautiful and
            unusual varieties of live-bearer fish. The sailfin mollie is arguably one of the most exotic fish available
            of any genus. However, mollies are perhaps the most difficult of all of the common live-bearers to keep as
            they are the most delicate of the live-bearers. When chilled or otherwise exposed to environmental stress of
            any kind, they tend to develop an ailment known commonly as “shimmies.” In reality, this is not an
            infectious disease but merely a compounding of symptoms of stress.

            Mollies are mostly found from Southern
            United States down into Central America. The native habitat of these fish extends from the southern United
            States to the Yucatan peninsula in Mexico, and they thrive mainly in freshwater environments, sometimes
            venturing into brackish estuaries. Mollies, like guppies, are capable of acclimating to full strength sea
            water temporarily, but it is not their natural environment by any means.

            The genus Mollienesia, from which the name mollie was derived, has been re-classified as Poecilia and is
            considered to be in the same genus as the guppy. For years it had been noticed that the guppy will, under
            certain circumstances, interbreed with the mollie, and the close relationship between the two has been
            confirmed genetically.</div>
